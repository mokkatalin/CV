Game description:
You can place light bulbs in the white cells. Light travels only along the rows and columns. Black cells block the light. Optionally, black cells can contain a number from 0 to 4, indicating how many neighboring cells should have a light bulb. Light bulbs shouldn't illuminate each other. The aim of the game is to light up all the white cells.
